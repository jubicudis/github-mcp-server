# github-mcp-server

This directory was restored as part of TNOS compliance. Please restore full code and configuration from backup or source control if available.

## Purpose
This folder is intended for the GitHub MCP server integration for TNOS. All code, settings, and logs must use canonical TNOS paths (e.g., `/systems/memory`, `/systems/tnos_shared/gradle`).

## Compliance
- No unauthorized root folders.
- All logs and build outputs must be under `/systems` or biosystem-specific subfolders.
- See documentation in `/docs/mcp/` for integration details.
